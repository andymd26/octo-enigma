\section{Where to incorporate climate information?}
Existing processes are the best spot to incorporate climate information, as compared to generating new processes.

\section{Unified Facilities Criteria}
The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) provide guidance for developing and maintaining unified facilities design and construction for planning, design, construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization of DoD facilities \parencite{}(\url{https://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?c=4}).
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) administer the UFC system within their own departments \parencite{} (\url{https://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?c=4}).
UFCs intended for all participating agencies have a document number that does not end in an alphabetical letter. 
Otherwise, a document with an 'A', 'N', or 'F' at the end of the document corresponds to guidance intended solely for the USACE, NAVFAC, or AFCEC, respectively \parencite{}(\url{https://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?c=4}).
UFCs are organized into four series: (1) Policy, Procedures, and Guidance; (2) Master Planning; (3) Discipline-specific Criteria; and, (4) Multi-disciplinary and Facility-Specific Design. 
A complete listing of the current UFCs can be found at \url{https://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?c=4}.

The UFCs are a good program to use as a platform for resilience building for several reasons.
First, UFCs are an existing program and would not require the creation of a new program, training users, and other associated costs of such an effort.
Second, given its use throughout the services, small changes in the UFCs could lead to large changes in resilience.
Third, there are multiple points in the UFC program where climate information could be integrated.
Finally, the program directly ties into the systems that we care about. 

Of the complete set of UFCs, we performed a cursory analysis to identify UFCs that would benefit from the integration of climate information, as well as climate projections.
